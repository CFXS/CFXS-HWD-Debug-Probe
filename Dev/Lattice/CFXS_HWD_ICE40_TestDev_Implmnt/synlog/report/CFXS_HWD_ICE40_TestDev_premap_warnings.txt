@W: MT529 :"x:\cfxs\cfxs-hdl-library\vhdl\components\pulsegenerator.vhd":31:8:31:9|Found inferred clock main|system_clock which controls 30 sequential elements including instance_SWD_Interface.instance_ProtocolClockPulse.reg_Counter[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
