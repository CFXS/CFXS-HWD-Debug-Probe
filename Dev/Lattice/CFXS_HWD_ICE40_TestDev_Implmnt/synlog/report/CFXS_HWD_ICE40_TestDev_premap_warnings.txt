@W: MT529 :"x:\cfxs\cfxs-hdl-library\vhdl\components\interfaces\swd.vhd":73:8:73:9|Found inferred clock main|system_clock which controls 15 sequential elements including instance_SWD_Interface.reg_SWCLK_DividerCounter[5:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
